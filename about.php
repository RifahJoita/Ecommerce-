    <h2>About Our Journey </h2>
    <p>Over a decade ago, we started a store to sell snowboards online. None of the ecommerce solutions at the time gave us the control we needed to be successful—so we built our own. Today, businesses of all sizes use Shopify, whether they’re selling online, in retail stores, or on-the-go.
</p>
<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
    <p>Making commerce better for everyone. We help people achieve independence by making it easier to start, run, and grow a business. We believe the future of commerce has more voices, not fewer, so we’re reducing the barriers to business ownership to make commerce better for everyone.</p>
